# DataMiningProject1
Repo for managing R code for a data mining course.  Assignment is to compare 2 different classification algorithms on two different data sets.

Requirements:
* Implement R code to compare two different algorithms to perform classification analysis.
* For each algorithm, calculate the Recall, Precision, F-Measure (F1)
* For each algorithm, generate an ROC curve and performn 10 Fold Cross Validation
* Write a 1 Page Report
* Apply algorithms to two data sets
* Algorithms must be in two different categories
