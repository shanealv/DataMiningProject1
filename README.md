# Data Mining Project
Repo for managing R code for a data mining course

Part 1 Requirements:
* Implement R code to compare two different algorithms to perform classification analysis.
* For each algorithm, calculate the Recall, Precision, F-Measure (F1)
* For each algorithm, generate an ROC curve and performn 10 Fold Cross Validation
* Apply algorithms to two data sets
* Algorithms must be in two different categories
* Write a one page report on your findings
